    <h1> Feminist Propaganda </h1>
    <p> An interactive experience designed to make people think about their relationship wth feminsim and gendered issues.
    the experience is built as a questionnaire that acts as an AI that takes your responses and forces you to think critically
  about them</p>
<div class="concept">
  <h2>What is your starting topic? What importance does it hold for you? For others?
    Why is it important to make this topic into an explorable networked space?</h2>
    <p> My starting topic is feminism as an ideology and philosophy. I have been actively supporting feminism and gender equality for many years now and I still think western society lacks the empathy to look at scenarios through a more feminine lens. I think it is incredibly important that we push people to try and break down their biases against feminism (saying thing like Feminist Propaganda and Femi-nazi and Feminist Bitch) and try and learn from and understand this sort of perspective. I think it is important to make this concept explorable because a big part of Feminism is to explore and challenge ideas about femininity, masculinity, oppression and opportunity while trying to include as many people as possible into the discussion.

  <h2>Think about the kind of relationship you wish to encourage between your users and this “space”. How can you use this “space” to
    destabilize the users and make them reflect on themselves, their environment and society?</h2>
    <p> As I mentioned before, I think it is important for people to try and think critically about feminism, and I think that includes addressing all its positive and negative aspects. Many shun feminism for criticizing men when feminists claim to want equal rights, and some define feminism as empowerment for white women and not people of colour, gay/bisexual women, trans women, and non-gender conforming people. My mission is to hopefully encourage people to think beyond their personal scopes and try and consider people and situations they might have never considered before. Furthermore, many people believe that they are not affected by patriarchy or misogynistic cultural practices, but they are deeply embedded in our day-to-day lives without us even realising it. I want to make people more aware of how this type of culture can affect everyone involved, not just women but men too.</p>

  <h2>Think about the notion of empowerment. Will your “space” help, challenge, teach, enable collaboration,
    understanding between user(s)? How and Why?</h2>
    <p> I really hope that my project will empower feminists with different backgrounds to appreciate their experiences and to appreciate the active work they are doing to promote equality and inclusion. I am hoping that by simulating a conversation with a “feminist” will allow people to feel less afraid about approaching this topic and embracing its nuances as well as the aspects people find empowering. Hopefully, my space will help people understand the complexities behind the movement and allow them to appreciate it even more. </p>

  <h2> Examples </h2>
  <p>All New Gen- VNS MATRIX </p>
  <p>FemTech Net</p>

<div class="conclusion">
  <h2> Conclusion</h2>
  <p> My project will be different from the former because it will directly confront anyone outside the feminist space on how they view feminism and hopefully force them to reconsider their biases.</p>
